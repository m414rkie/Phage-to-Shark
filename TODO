Implement a method of finding richness.
	- Use carrying capacity as a variable

Method of outputing effective burst size

Convert everything to snake-case

2-24-20

Carrying capacity on the order of 10E7
	- will impact bactouch, phage numbers, burst count
	- Double check changeability of burst size
	- Email CS for the paper
	
Burst size tied to carrying capacity
	- Reduce VMR 
	- three burst sizes, coral 50 algae middle barrier 10
	- local
	
Compile list of things accomplished
	- Send on Thursday
	- How to run script finalized 
	
Separate the Usage from the Internals in the readme
	- Folder containing a default values run including output graphs
	- Seeds how to input and storage thereof
	
Send Dr. Luque the classes I had to take as well as short descriptions of methodology

Run 27220202
- no fish interaction with microbe layer
- Burst count as step function
Coral = 50 ; Algae = 30 ; Barrier = 10

Run 2722020
 - fish interaction
 - Burst count as step function
 Coral = 50 ; Algae = 30 ; Barrier = 10

Run 27220201
 - fish interaction reduced to growth only
 - Burst count as step function
 Coral = 100 ; Algae = 60 ; Barrier = 10
