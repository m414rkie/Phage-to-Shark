Implement a method of finding richness.
	- Use carrying capacity as a variable

Method of outputing effective burst size

Convert everything to snake-case

2-24-20

Carrying capacity on the order of 10E7
	- will impact bactouch, phage numbers, burst count
	- Double check changeability of burst size
	- Email CS for the paper
	
Burst size tied to carrying capacity
	- Reduce VMR 
	- three burst sizes, coral 50 algae middle barrier 10
	- local
	
Compile list of things accomplished
	- Send on Thursday
	- How to run script finalized 
	
Separate the Usage from the Internals in the readme
	- Folder containing a default values run including output graphs
	- Seeds how to input and storage thereof
	
Send Dr. Luque the classes I had to take as well as short descriptions of methodology

Run 27220202
- no fish interaction with microbe layer
- Burst count as step function
Coral = 50 ; Algae = 30 ; Barrier = 10

Run 2722020
 - fish interaction
 - Burst count as step function
 Coral = 50 ; Algae = 30 ; Barrier = 10

Run 27220201
 - fish interaction reduced to growth only
 - Burst count as step function
 Coral = 100 ; Algae = 60 ; Barrier = 10
 
Run 27220202
 - fish interaction, second term reduced to 0.25
 - Burst count as step function
	 Coral = 100 ; Algae = 60 ; Barrier = 10 
 - lysogen carrying capacity error fixed
	
Run 2822020 - Best 
	- richness ceiling increased to 100 from 10
	- Burst Count 100 - 60 - 10
	
Run 2922020
	- Burst 100 - 50 - 5
	- Bact-Coral interaction reduced 15 -> 12
	
Run 2922020 1
	- richness changed to 1/(1 - k_mod/k_max) - 1
	- results in too high of a richness
	
Run 2922020 2
	- richness changed to (k_mod/k_max)^2
	- results in compressed values
	
Run 2922020 3
	- Burst 100 30 5
	- R_lys  = 2.5
	- richness k_mod/k_max
	
Run 2922020 4
	- same as 3 R_lys = 2.0

Run 2922020 5
	- fish modifier reduced
	- poor results
	
Run 2922020 6
	- fish modifier increased
	- continuous burst function

Run 2922020 9
	- Continuous burst function
	- reduced fish impact
	
Run 2922020 10
	- Step burst function modified by fish impact

Run 2922020 11
	- Step burst function modified by inverse fish impact
	- bactouch cap increased to 1E8
	- inverse trends
	
Final run
	- coral bact interaction reduced from 0.15 to 0.11

TODO
	- Auto graph most common outputs
	
MEETING

Notes:
	- cc changing order of magnitude 7 - 6 based on region
	- find steady state parameters. equilibration points and values for each. 
	- system stability at 60%, 40% naturally 
	- fish, microbe evolution w/out coral interaction, use outputs
	- follow up with CS
	- barrier cannot reasonably be highest value
	- initial bact. pop change from 0.001 to 0.5
	- paper with decay rate change suggests a change of 10^2 in phage decay rate. may also affect burst size
	- run simulation with lower bacteria
	
TODO 
	PRIORITY - system stability at 60% coral with all interactions running
	richness criteria from N* where N* is determined at .5 carrying capacity cc/bac = some max N 0.5N = N*
	steady N* or adjustable N* based on ss values of bacteria
	add output bucket for matching to github ( default values etc.) with outputs. "Quality Control Test"
	
New Paper: 
	- Burst size counts from 5 - 100
	- viral decay rate can change from 20 - 01 1/Lhr
